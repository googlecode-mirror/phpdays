You can help us to improve the documentation, fix errors in it, and translate it into other languages.

### Translating the Documentation ###

To translate the documentation into other languages you should know the following:
  * page names start with a language name abbreviation _(Ru for Russian, En for English, Fr for French)_
  * go to the page you would like to translate _(for example [RuAnswers](RuAnswers.md))_
  * click "Edit this page" at the top of the page to see the page in the wiki format
  * copy the content of the page in the original language
  * point your browser to a translated page by changing the language prefix in the name of the page _(for example, if you opened RuAnswers and are going to translate it to English, change the name to EnAnswers)_
  * if the page does not exist, you will be offered to create it _(click the "Create a New Page" link)_
  * paste the copied content in the original language
  * translate the text from the original language
  * at the top of the text edit the title of the page in the `#summary` line
  * add/edit a `#sidebar Xx` line  _(where Xx is the language of the newly translated page)_
  * click "Preview" to check the page's formatting
  * click "Save page" to save the page

Also think next:
  * not translate keyword `#summary` _(describe page content)_. This line show in [list of all wiki pages](http://code.google.com/p/phpdays/w/list)
  * no tranclate keyword `#sidebar` _(page language)_. Start from capitalize letter
  * change links to current tranclation. For example, change `[En link text]` to `[Ru текст ссылки]`

When a document is translated a wiki comment with a revision number (`<wiki:comment>revision: xx</wiki:comment>`) must be copied from the original document.

To follow changes in the documentation go to [Source - Changes](http://code.google.com/p/phpdays/source/list) _(available at the top)_.
